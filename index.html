            <p><b>I</b> am a Software Engineer in Austin, Texas.</p>
            <p><b>I</b> developed an interest for web and app development during the quarantine. I saw this meme one day that was like "If you didnt learn a new skill during the quarantine then you wasted your time." That pushed me from then on to learn something new. I would scroll almost mindlessly through all my social medias and just waste so much time. So I figured "Why not develop my own games? Or my own websites and applications? Then...I could mindlessly scroll and get paid for it!" So my software googling began, which led me to some great sites:</p>

            <p>
               <b>A</b>nd eventually led me to 
               <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, a coding bootcamp that I felt stood out from the many I had tried. Now starting off wasnt easy at all. I had to completely rewire my brain. From the way my thought process worked, to the habits I had developed over my whole life. But I was willing to grow beyond my comfort zone and learn new things regardless of the challenges and willing to work together to accomplish things for a greater goal.

               <b>B</b>efore learning to code I was an aspiring Musician/Songwriter from "The Live Music Capital Of The World!" Imagine how hard it is to become a successful Musician in a city with literally THOUSANDS of people trying to do the same. Thus, I took my hiatus.
